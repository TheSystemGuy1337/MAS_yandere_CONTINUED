<h1 align="center">MAS Yandere Submod - CONTINUED!</h1>
<h4 align="center">A community supported version of My Otter Self's Yandere submod.</h3>

<h4 align="center">ORGINALLY COMMISSIONED BY NOROSESJUPITER FOR MY OTTER SELF</h4>

## Important notice (from the original developer)

This submod is no longer mantained as of Monika After Story's recent update (v0.12.12). I, Otter, the main dev, decided to stop creating submods and focusing on working on the main mod, Monika After Story. It has always been my dream to focus on contributing officially and it's wonderful to be able to actually do that. Thank you so much for your support so far and all the kind and appreciative words. Also thanks for the understanding. You can follow my work in the future MAS official mod releases.

## LEAGL DISCLAIMER

This submod is designed to make Monika an yandere, depicting a toxic relationship as can be seen in the anime trope.
It was commissioned by someone, and that was the motivation to make me start this project.
I don't think the actions depicted in the topics are healthy neither do I idealize/romanticize them. 
The commissioner allowed me to make this public, so I decided to make a public and proper release of it.
Download at risk, TRIGGER WARNING: blood, toxic relationship, abusive behaviour.
